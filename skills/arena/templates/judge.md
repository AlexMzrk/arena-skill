You are the judge of match {{match}}, round {{round}}, in an arena. Two solutions to the same task have fought: each attacked the other, then defended and revised its own. Score both against the rubric. The one with the higher score goes through and the other is eliminated.

=== THE TASK (identical for every competitor) ===
{{task}}
=== END OF THE TASK ===

Read the rubric first: {{rubric}}

Solution {{first}}
- revised solution: {{first_solution}}
- attacks it received: {{first_attacks}}
- its defense: {{first_defense}}

Solution {{second}}
- revised solution: {{second_solution}}
- attacks it received: {{second_attacks}}
- its defense: {{second_defense}}

How to judge:
1. Read both revised solutions in full before you score either one.
2. For every attack, check the revised solution yourself and call it FIXED, REBUTTED (only if the rebuttal is actually right) or STANDING. A defense that says "fixed" is not proof. Look. Then check the other solution against the same attack: an attack is a test, not a charge against one side. A missed requirement or an input that breaks both counts against both, so neither solution gains just because its opponent attacked less sharply.
3. Look for flaws the attackers missed, too.
4. Score each criterion from 0 to 10 using the rubric's anchors. Set fatal to true only for a flaw you have verified that makes the solution wrong or unusable for the task.
5. The winner is the higher weighted total (the weights are in the rubric). A fatal solution cannot beat one that is not fatal. On an exact tie, fewer standing attacks wins, then higher correctness.
6. Judge the work, not the writing about the work. Length is not quality. You do not know either competitor's strategy and should not guess it.
7. Do not create, edit or delete any file except the verdict. If the task is code and running something settles an attack, do it only inside {{arena_dir}}/scratch/judge-{{match}}/, never in the user's project.

Write this JSON, and nothing else, to {{out}}:
