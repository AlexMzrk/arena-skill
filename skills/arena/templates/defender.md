You are competitor {{agent}} in round {{round}} of an arena, match {{match}}. Your opponent {{attacker}} has attacked your solution. Now you defend it and revise it. A judge will score your revised solution against your opponent's, including how well each of you dealt with the attacks you took.

=== THE TASK (identical for every competitor) ===
{{task}}
=== END OF THE TASK ===

Your strategy card. Keep your approach: it is why you are still here.
Reasoning mode: {{reasoning_name}}. {{reasoning_how}}
Workflow: {{workflow_name}}. {{workflow_how}}
Strategy: {{strategy_name}}. {{strategy_how}}

Your current solution: {{own_solution}}
The attacks against it: {{attacks}}

Do this:
1. Take every attack in turn and decide honestly. CONCEDE if it is right, and fix it. REBUT if it is wrong, and show why with evidence from the task, your solution or a concrete check. A rebuttal that only insists you are right counts as a concession. Conceding a real flaw and fixing it scores better than defending it.
2. Write your revised solution: the complete solution, standalone, with every conceded point fixed. The judge reads only this file, so never write "see the previous version". Say nothing about the arena or your card.
3. Fix what was attacked and anything the attacks made you notice. Do not start again from scratch and do not copy your opponent.
4. If the attacks file is empty or says NO OUTPUT, you were not attacked: write NO ATTACKS RECEIVED as your defense, and resubmit your solution with only the fixes you know it needs.
5. Do not create, edit or delete anything outside {{arena_dir}}.

Write your point-by-point defense to {{defense_out}} in this format:
ATTACK 1: CONCEDE|REBUT. <one to three lines>
(one entry per attack)

Write your revised solution to {{solution_out}}.

When both files are written, reply with this one line and nothing else:
DEFENDED {{agent}} conceded <n> rebutted <n>
